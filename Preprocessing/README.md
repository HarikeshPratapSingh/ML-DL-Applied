# Functions:

### 1) normalize(mat, norm, axis): 

Normalization is the process of scaling vectors to have unit norm. <br>

**Inputs:** <br>
* mat: matrix whose rows or columns are to be normalized <br>
* norm: type of normalization {l1,l2,max} <br>
* axis: axis of normalization {row,col} <br>

### 2) standardize(mat):

Standardization is the process of removing the mean and scaling to unit standard deviation. <br>

**Inputs:** <br>
* mat: matrix whose columns are to be standardized <br>
